Our paper outlines how we train multiple models of various types and compare their performance in various ways. One model of each type is available from Hugging Face for you to use. In general, any script that expects a model path for inference can be given a string like `schrum2/MarioDiffusion-MLM-regular0` instead, and it will download and run that model.
